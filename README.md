# All possible Android Lock Pattern Combination ScreenSaver!

I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyCAialVM2M) on YouTube and decided I wanted that as my screensaver
then I spent almost as long as the video is (12 hours) recreating the project

[These](https://github.com/greigdp/android-pattern-combinations) [Two](https://github.com/BTC-Bradley/Android-Unlock-Patterns) 
existing github repositories were very helpful but I found thier solution a little over complicated. All you really need is a 
simple 12 line recursize function

You can preview my work [here](http:/htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/benjameep/android-lock/blob/master/index.html). If you
want this screen saver as well, I suggest you download it so that it will run faster.
